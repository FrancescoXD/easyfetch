# easyfetch
A very simple and bad coded rust linux fetcher. Works only on ArchLinux.

# How to compile
This is a Rust project, so you need the rust compiler. When downloaded do:
```
cargo run
```

It's easy no?

# Enable it globally
```
$ cargo build --release
$ sudo mv target/release/easyfetch /usr/local/bin
```

And then you can start it everywhere.
